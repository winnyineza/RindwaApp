# ⚡ **Real-Time Updates Improved - Much Faster Refresh Intervals**

## 🚀 **Changes Made**

You're absolutely right that 30 seconds was way too long! I've dramatically reduced the auto-refresh intervals across your entire application for much more responsive real-time updates.

| **Dashboard Widgets (Incidents)** | 30s | **6s** | Emergency incident monitoring |

### **🏢 Management Pages (7-8 seconds)**

## 🎯 **Specific Improvements**

### **🔄 Invitation-to-User Flow**
- **Invitations Tab**: Refreshes every **5 seconds** (was 30s)

- **Station Admin Widgets**: All critical data refreshes every **6 seconds** (was 30s)
- **Station Staff Widgets**: All critical data refreshes every **6 seconds** (was 30s)

## 🔋 **Performance Considerations**

### **Smart Intervals Chosen:**
- **5-6 seconds**: Critical emergency data that needs immediate updates
- **7-8 seconds**: Important management data with slightly less urgency
- **10 seconds**: User/staff data that changes less frequently

### **Still Efficient:**
- Uses `refetchOnWindowFocus: true` for instant updates when switching tabs
- React Query caching prevents unnecessary API calls
- Automatic pause when component unmounts
